## Introduction
### Why should we care about chromosome analysis?
Cancer cells have been shown to have genetic mutations that lead to uncontrolled cell division that can often lead to the creation of tumors (1). This happens through oncogenes, a mutated gene that has the potential to turn cancerous, that is carried in extrachromosomal DNA, also known as ecDNA (1). This tells us that cell research is vital to the knowledge and understanding of cancer. The analyzing of cells, though, is often tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error. 

It’s important to count individual chromosomes because as new ones form, ecDNA also replicates which means that the copy number of oncogenes grows. It’s also vital to be able to identify if new chromosomes have been created because we can get a sense of whether chromosomes are duplicated or fragmented, giving us more information on cancer cells and their growth.
